Hello There!!

Daniel here, I like Python and R. I'm an Industrial Engineer from Bogot√°, Colombia with experience in Logistics, Supply Chain and Procurement. Since I finished my Graduate Certificate in Logistics and Supply Chain, I started to investigate in Data Science and Big Data. Right now! I'm thrilled to announce I'm learning to programming in Python and discover the amazing path in Data Science, Machine Learning and AI.

See you there!

D.R.
